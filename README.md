== Project Lucifer  2.0 ==
A next-generation, voice-activated personal assistant designed to run locally on your PC. Lucifer 2.0 is highly intelligent, personalized, and extensible, prioritizing user privacy and control above all else.

Overview
Project Lucifer 2.0 is a self-contained, intelligent agent that augments your interaction with your digital and physical environment. Unlike mainstream cloud-based assistants, Lucifer 2.0 performs all core AI processing—understanding your voice and thinking—locally on your machine.

It leverages a constant internet connection to fetch real-time data and control external devices, but your personal data, voice patterns, and learned behaviors never leave your computer. The system is designed to continuously learn from you, becoming a truly personalized assistant that adapts to your unique voice, vocabulary, and habits.

Key Features
Voice-Activated Interface: Hands-free operation through a customizable wake word (default: "Jarvis").

Deep Personalization: Designed for a single user, the system learns your unique voice, accent, and command patterns for unparalleled accuracy.

Continuous On-Device Learning: The AI models improve over time by being fine-tuned on your interaction data, which is stored and processed locally.

Hybrid Online/Offline Processing: Core AI logic runs locally for privacy and speed, while an active internet connection is used for real-time data and controlling external services.

Extensible Task Automation: Control local PC applications, perform complex web queries, and integrate seamlessly with smart home (IoT) devices via platforms like Home Assistant.

Modular & Open-Source: Built with a preference for open-source technologies, allowing for transparency, customization, and easy upgrades.

Architecture & Technology Stack
Lucifer 2.0 is built on a classic, modular voice-AI pipeline. All core components run locally, ensuring privacy and responsiveness.

Wake Word Detection: A lightweight engine listens for the activation command.

Speech-to-Text (STT): Whisper transcribes spoken audio to text.

Natural Language Understanding (NLU): A local LLM like Llama (run via Ollama or GPT4All) interprets intent.

Action Execution: A Python-based engine performs tasks.

Text-to-Speech (TTS): Bark converts text responses into natural-sounding speech.

Primary Language: Python 3.8+

Dialogue Management: LangChain

System Requirements
Recommended Hardware
OS: Windows 11 or Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (64-bit)

CPU: Modern multi-core processor (e.g., AMD Ryzen 7, Intel Core i7)

GPU: NVIDIA RTX series GPU with 6GB+ VRAM (highly recommended for performance)

RAM: 16 GB+

Storage: 100+ GB of free space for models and data logs.

Peripherals: A high-quality USB microphone.

Minimum Hardware (CPU-only)
CPU: Modern multi-core processor

RAM: 8-16 GB

Storage: 100+ GB

Installation & Setup
(Detailed instructions will be provided upon initial release.)

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/Jarvis-2.0.git
cd Jarvis-2.0

Set up Python Environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Download AI Models:

A setup script will be provided to download the necessary STT, NLU, and TTS models.

Configure the System:

Edit the config.yaml file to set up your microphone, speaker, API keys, and other preferences.

Run the Assistant:

python main.py

Future Scope
Our vision for Jarvis 2.0 extends beyond voice. The modular architecture is designed to be future-proof. The next frontier is Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) integration, allowing for thought-based control by feeding commands from a BCI directly into the NLU engine.
